# Ml-Projects

These are my Machine learning course projects. Problem Descriptions are given below.
1. Hand written digit recongnition: Use ANN to classify Hand written digits. MNIST data is used in this problem
2. Comparision Models: We need to compare different Ml classifier algorithms(Here only KNN , Logistic regression) on a dataset and evaluate model performances.
